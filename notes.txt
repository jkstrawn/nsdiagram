add box before
	I think that a menu or a mouse-pointer–visual-queue with a positional switch would be a good possible solution.

floating menu
copy-paste blocks

	Redo		ctrl-X
	Copy 		ctrl-C
	Paste 		ctrl-V

Load locked my computer undo worked. This either has been fixed or is only occasional. 

To start, as the chart extends downward the tool-bar becomes in accessible

made it so a single-click made it possible to select and edit text; 

then where it makes sense for a double click to open a menu to select a new item to insert. 


It also becomes cramped with nested statements. I think a possible solution may be to change the width of the top of the chart to an 11” view; then export as several images that have been flipped and cut into “word document sized pieces” ,with page numbers (so that they can be pasted into a document page by page);  Maybe then  an option to switch between the two modes.




BUGS

I noticed sometimes with the load feature it will compress entirely to one line outside of the frame (google chrome + fire Fox) but this seems to be only occasional. 

I also noticed the new buttons do not always show up in Firefox sometimes only two empty frames show in Firefox (load and undo).
